# Fama-French-5-factor-model

In this seminar, the primary goal is to prepare you for quantitative research in financial economics through a structured and personalized approach:

Choosing a Topic:

Select a paper (edit: I have chosen A five-factor asset princing model by Fama/French (2014)) from a high-ranked journal (A+), such as those from AER.
Choose based on the abstract or title, ensuring the dataset is available.
Submit your chosen topic via email with the subject "[RS18] Topic selection" and include the article link.
Familiarizing with the Topic:

Read the paper thoroughly and review related literature.
Understand the paper's objectives, methods, results, and limitations.
Attend office hours or email for discussion and questions.
Working on the Data:

Analyze the dataset and replicate the main regressions.
Seek help for econometric issues via email, and attend sessions set up for these topics.
Aim to replicate the technical aspects of the paper.
Extending the Paper:

Conduct your own research by extending the paperâ€™s analysis (e.g., using different data, adding new variables, or applying the methodology to a new problem).
This step is about creativity and independent research; your success in this part will not affect your grade.
Goal:
Gain hands-on experience in quantitative financial research, learn through practice, and develop your ability to conduct independent research.
